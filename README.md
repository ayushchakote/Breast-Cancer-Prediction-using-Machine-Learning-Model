Objective:
Utilize a dataset to apply the basic principles of machine learning.
Analyze, understand, and provide evidence for our conclusions and interpretations using the Jupyter notebook's observed dataset.

The analysis is divided into 4 sections.
  1. Identifying the problem statement and Data Sources
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis
  3. Pre-Processing the Data
  4. Buid the model to predict whether breast cell tissue is Maligaant or Bengin
Recognizing the issue and Sources of Data
Investigative Data Analysis

Part 1: Determining the issue and obtaining information.
Goal:List the different kinds of data that are included in our data set. We'll utilize Python modules to import external data sets so that we may become acquainted with the information in order to better understand it and consider various approaches to handling it. 

Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
Objective: Investigate the factors and evaluate their relationship to the response variable. Using Python packages (Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn), we will explore and visualize the data in this notebook to become acquainted with it. It is crucial to get familiar with the data since this will give you critical knowledge for pre-processing the data.

Part 3: Data Pre-Processing
The goal is to identify the data's most predictive properties and filter it to increase the analytics model's capacity for prediction. To reduce high-dimension data, we'll utilize feature selection; to lower dimensionality, we'll use feature extraction and transformation. In order to prepare the data for the development of predictive models, this is crucial.

Part 4: Support Vector Machine (svm)-based predictive model
Goal: Develop predictive methods to forecast breast tumor diagnoses. Using the SVM machine learning technique, we will build a predictive model to forecast the diagnosis of a breast tumor. A breast tumor's diagnosis might be either benign or malignant. The receiver operating curves (ROC), which are crucial for analyzing and deciphering the fitted model, will also be used to evaluate the model using the confusion matrix.

Part 5: Support Vector Classifier Optimization
Goal: Develop predictive methods to forecast breast tumor diagnoses. Our goal is to use scikit-learn to fine-tune the SVM Classification model's parameters.
